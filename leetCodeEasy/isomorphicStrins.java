// Algorithm -
/*
1. We first check if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If not, then we return false.
2. We create a HashMap to store the characters of the first string as keys and 
the characters of the second string as values.
3. We then iterate through the characters of the first string and check if the character is 
already present in the HashMap as a key. If it is, then we check if the value of the key in 
the HashMap is equal to the character in the second string. If not, then we return false.
4. If the character is not present in the HashMap as a key, then we check if the character 
of the second string is already present in the HashMap as a value. If it is, then we return false.
5. If the character is not present in the HashMap as a key and the character is not present in 
the HashMap as a value, then we add the character as a key and the character of the second 
string as a value to the HashMap.
6. Finally, we return true.
